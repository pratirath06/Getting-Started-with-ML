Introduction
------------

Machine learning requires meticulous data handling and preprocessing to ensure high-quality and effective models. This repository provides a Python script that covers a wide range of essential data manipulation tasks, from loading and visualizing data to handling missing values and outliers.

Features
--------

The script includes the following functionalities:

1.  **Loading Data**: Import data from various sources like CSV, Excel, and databases.
    
2.  **Describing Data**: Generate summary statistics for your dataset.
    
3.  **Data Visualization**: Create plots and charts to visualize data distributions and relationships.
    
4.  **Data Distribution Analysis**: Analyze the distribution of numerical data.
    
5.  **Categorical Data Analysis**: Analyze and visualize categorical data.
    
6.  **Data Relationships**: Explore correlations and relationships between variables.
    
7.  **Missing Data Analysis**: Identify and handle missing data.
    
8.  **Outlier Analysis**: Detect and manage outliers in the dataset.
    
9.  **Handling Inconsistent Data**: Address inconsistencies in data formats and types.
    
10.  **Dealing with Data Types**: Convert data types as necessary for analysis.
    
11.  **Handling Inconsistent Data Formats**: Standardize formats for dates, numbers, etc.
    
12.  **Handling Missing Values**: Impute or remove missing values.
    
13.  **Handling Zero or Negative Values**: Manage zero or negative values appropriately.
    
14.  **Removing Duplicates**: Identify and remove duplicate records.
    
15.  **Checking Missing Values**: Verify missing data after preprocessing steps.
    
16.  **Feature Scaling**: Normalize or standardize features.
    
17.  **Feature Engineering**: Create new features from existing data.
    
18.  **Handling Text Data**: Process and analyze text data.
    
19.  **Transform Lists to String**: Convert list data types to string.
    
20.  **Data Filtering**: Filter data based on specific conditions.
    
21.  **Aggregation and Grouping**: Aggregate and group data for analysis.
    
22.  **Exporting the Data**: Export the processed data to files or databases.
    

Installation
------------

1.  Clone the repository
2.  git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Getting-Started-with-ML.git
3.  cd Getting-Started-with-ML
    

Usage
-----

1.  Navigate to the repository directory
2.  cd Getting-Started-with-ML
    
1.  Run the main script
2.  python main.py
